# tripwire config
# ---------------------
# Categories are matched by name to your YNAB budget categories.
# No need to look up category IDs anymore!
#
# Auto-alerts:
#   enabled: set to true to automatically create alerts for all YNAB categories with budgeted amounts
#   exclude: list of category names to skip even if they have budgeted amounts
#   rules: default alert rules to apply to auto-detected categories
#
# Explicit category configuration (optional if auto_alerts is enabled):
#   enabled: set to false to temporarily disable alerts for this category
#   spending_limit: "auto" (use YNAB budgeted amount) or explicit number (e.g. 800 for $800/month)
#   rules: list of alert rules (same structure as auto_alerts rules)
#
# Rule types:
#   type: goal_threshold | pacing (historical_average TBD)
#   min_hours_between_alerts: minimum hours between repeated alerts for the same trigger.
#       For goal_threshold this effectively means "fire once" if set high (e.g. 744 = 31 days).
#       For pacing this is the re-alert cadence — e.g. 24 means once per day.
#   triggers: list of threshold + severity pairs
#     at: threshold expression. Syntax depends on rule type:
#           goal_threshold:
#             "$X remaining"  = alert when dollars remaining drops to X or below
#             "X%"            = alert when percentage of goal spent reaches X or above
#           pacing:
#             "X% over"       = alert when projected end-of-month spend exceeds goal by X%+
#     severity: warning | urgent
#
# pacing-only fields:
#   warm_up_hours: don't evaluate pacing until this many hours into the month.
#       Prevents noisy false positives from single early transactions.
